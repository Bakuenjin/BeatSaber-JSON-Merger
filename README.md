# BeatSaber-JSON-Merger
A small beatmap merger for collaborative mapping projects.

Basic functionality working.

`Base map` is the file that is used for defining those overall information like NodeJumpSpeed or BPM.

`Map parts` are the files that contain all map fractions you want to merge (including obstacles and events). The base map can be a map part too.

`Save path` is the path to the location you want the merged file to be placed at.


Thats all basically, if you have any questions or future idea, I would recommend to ask me on Discord.
